Welcome to the python project of Group 1 of the Societal Challenge Project of the master progam of Engineering And Policy Analysis. 
We tried to map the most influential contextual factors for determining the suitability of placing a Refugee Shelter on a neighbourhood-level in the Netherlands. 
The data is unfortunately not linked directly to the CBS package, as it was not updated (meaning is had the correct files). 
We hope the project is useful, the page is in our opinion clear and minimalistic. 

But just to be sure, a small explaination of the page. 

In this project the python file called: Societal_Challenge_Project_final.ipynb is the source and only file. 

There are 3 other files needed for the data, these are also mentioned in the python file and are availible on the GitHub page.
